# **AirBnB-Zillow-Data-Challenge:**

## **Introduction:**

The objective of this project is to investigate best areas (zipcode) in New York City for rental properties investment.

## **Data source:**

AirBnB data: 
http://data.insideairbnb.com/united-states/ny/new-york-city/2017-05-02/data/listings.csv.gz
Zillow data:
Zip_Zhvi_2bedroom.csv

## **Abstract:**

We have already known that two bedroom properties are the most profitable on short-term rentals in New York City. To further investigate which areas (zip codes) are the best to invest in, we use AirBnB and Zillow data as the references for Revenue and Cost, respectively.
